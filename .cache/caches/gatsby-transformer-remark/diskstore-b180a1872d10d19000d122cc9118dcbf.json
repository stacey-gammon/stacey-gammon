I’ve finally decided to build a personal website using Gatsby and Netlify.</p>\n<p>So far, I’m impressed. I love this ability to write blog posts in markdown and upload them to github.</p>\n<p>Eventually I’d like to explore writing more code on this site. One of my first introductions to programming, when I was just a\nlittle girl, was from my father, also a computer programmer. He helped me write my first two programs -  a maze in which an error\nwould pop up if your “mouse” went over the walls, and a “Mr. potato head”-ish like app where I could choose faces, eyes, ears and nose\nto create a custom avatar.</p>"}
