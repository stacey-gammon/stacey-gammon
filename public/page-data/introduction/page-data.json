I love this ability to write blog posts in markdown and upload them to github.</p>\n<p>Eventually I’d like to explore writing more code on this site. One of my first introductions to programming, when I was just a\nlittle girl, was from my father, also a computer programmer. He helped me write my first two programs -  a maze in which an error\nwould pop up if your “mouse” went over the walls, and a “Mr. potato head”-ish like app where I could choose faces, eyes, ears and nose\nto create a custom avatar. Sometimes, for the sheer sentimentality of it, I think about rewriting those apps in javascript.</p>\n<p>My daugther is almost five and is obssessed with Roblox. I’m hoping it may someday encourage her to likewise get into development. I\nalways found it… magical.</p>\n<p>Till we meet again,</p>\n<p>~ Stacey</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Nice to meet you","date":"May 04, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/introduction/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
