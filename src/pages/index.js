        I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating scalable, efficient, and maintanable solutions.
        I love coding and tech, but also understand software development is about more than just code.
        It's about people, relationships, communication, and business. At the end of the day, if I have
        a challenge in front of me, am surrounded by good people, and have an opportunity to learn, I'm happy!
